# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

```java
public int removeDuplicates(int[] A) {
    int len = A.length;
    if (A.length <= 1) return len;

    int i = 0;
    int j = 1;

    for (; j < A.length; j++) {
        int val = A[i];
        if(val == A[j]) {
            len--;
            continue;
        }
        else
            A[++i] = A[j];
    }

    return len;
}
```

Similar to 80, this \(26\) keeps two pointers as well. This is more concise because of the use of ++ operator and due to the requirement that digit appears at most ONCE not two times.

* Time: O\(n\)
* Space: O\(1\)
